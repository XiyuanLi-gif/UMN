If we get {1,0}, we think we get a tail using a unbiased coin whose probability of heads is 1 in 2. If we get {1,1} or {0,0}, we should toss the coin twice again. In this way, we can use a biased coin to simulate generation of samples from the equivalent to the unbiased coin whose probability of giving heads is 1 in 2.\n",

If we get {1,0}, we regard it as B. If we get {0,1}, we regard it as C. If we get {0,0}， we toss the unbiased coin again until we get A, B or C.
