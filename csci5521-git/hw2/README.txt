I use Spyder to write the code for question 3 in python 3.7. For Question 3, I use my own cross_val function and socre function in hw1, 
which I just copy it and add something about the multigaussclassify. I put the hw2q3() and MultiGaussClassify in the same py file. 
And when I  run the code, I find that there are some warning which shows that when working on P(C), it may encounter the situation which
divided by 0.
