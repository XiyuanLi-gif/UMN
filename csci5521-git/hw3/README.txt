I use Spyder to write the code for question 3 in python 3.7. For Question 3, I use my own cross_val function and socre function in hw1 and 2, 
which I just copy it and add something about the mylogistic2. I put the hw3q3() and MyLogistic2 in the same py file. 
And when I  run the code, I find that it will take a long time to run the first test, which is MyLogisticReg2 with Boston50. It may cause fail in vole because of 
it's long time. However, it works well on my computer.
